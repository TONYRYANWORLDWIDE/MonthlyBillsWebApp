# MonthlyBillsWebApp
Web version of Windows Forms Budgeting App

Once a user is logged in they simply need to navigate to each page, filling in their Monthly and Weekly Bills, income, and current bank balance. 
From here they will navigate to the "Upcoming Bills" page which when loaded will show their projected cash flows for the next 90 days.

## Next Steps

* Include form to update each page the page itself without requiring the user to navigate to a separate page
* Copy the functionality of the "Monthly Bills" page that allows the user to edit and delete a given line from the page itself.
* Use Plaid API to allow users to handle bank logins for users
